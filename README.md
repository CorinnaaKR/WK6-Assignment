User Stories
🐿️ As a developer, I want the application to use the useState hook so that user interactions (like selecting an image) are smooth and the gallery’s state is managed effectively.
🐿️ As a developer, I want to use the useEffect hook to perform side effects, such as fetching image data from an external API.
🐿️ As a developer, I want to create separate files that return JSX instead of including all JSX within App.jsx so that the code is well-organized, making the app more maintainable and reliable for the user.

🐿️ As a user, I want to see a collection of image thumbnails displayed clearly on the page.
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to click on an image thumbnail to view a larger version of that image, possibly in a modal or a dedicated view.
🐿️ As a user who relies on assistive technologies, I want images to have descriptive alt text so I can understand their content.
🐿️ As a user who navigates with a keyboard, I want to be able to tab through the interactive elements (like thumbnails and buttons) in a logical order.

Requirements
🎯 Implement the useState hook to manage gallery state (e.g. selected image).
🎯 Use useEffect for initial fetching of images from an external API.
🎯 Return JSX from multiple components (e.g., an ImageItem component for each image and a Gallery component to display them).
🎯 Use the .map() function to render an array of images dynamically
🎯 Implement functionality to display a larger version of an image when its thumbnail is clicked.
🎯 Ensure all images have meaningful alt text.
🎯 Ensure basic keyboard navigation for image selection (e.g., thumbnails should be focusable and activatable with Enter/Space).

REFLECTIONS
Started the task by panicking to Manny that I felt like while i understood the react content this week, I hadn't absorbed it at all, and now my brain is drawing too many different pieces together without knowing what to start with it. Manny advised breaking it down into steps, and he helped me through the steps of push a folder from my computer to github - I knew the steps but was getting flustered trying to remember the order. Manny encouraged me to look at the user stories for the brief - not the developer ones - as they would tell me what was required in the project. I completed the set up for the project by following Manny's demo video for the brief, and then started on making my wireframe.
